### Intro
It is my first project. It is a console-based quiz game made using ``c++`` with login, sign-up functionality. You can select a topic ``( sports, science, C++, Maths )`` for the quiz. Once a topic is selected the game will show rules which will say +10 for the correct answer and -5 for the wrong answer.

Once you have press any key on the keyboard the game will start loading 10 questions one by one with 4 options. At the end of 10 questions, you will see your points. You can also play again.

### What those file means:
- ``game.h``  file contains all the function declaration
- ``game.cpp`` file contains all the function definition.
- ``main.cpp`` file import above file for calling and implementation.


### Notice 
- When you run this file it create a ``.txt file`` in the same directory which contains the login ID and password. If you will delete it, login process won't work.
- It will also create a ``game.exe`` executable which you can run for playing the game. 
- One of the ``drawback`` of this project is that, you cannot skip the question.
